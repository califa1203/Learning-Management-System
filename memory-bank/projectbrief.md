Building a Full-Stack LMS with Next.js,
Tailwind, TypeScript & PostgreSQL
Welcome to the LMS project guide! In this step-by-step course, we’ll build a Learning
Management System (LMS) from scratch. The LMS will include multiple user roles, interactive
features (quizzes, chat, video lessons), and a modern UI. This guide is designed for beginners
in front-end development, following a proven, hands-on method that rapidly takes you from
novice to intermediate with a 90% success rate. We’ll use a professional yet approachable tone,
with detailed instructions and best practices at every step. Let’s get started!
Project Overview and Objectives
Before diving in, let's clarify what we're building and the key features of our LMS application:
●​ Modern Landing Page: A welcoming home page with an interactive hero section (e.g.,
a prominent banner or call-to-action) followed by a grid layout showcasing all available
subjects or courses.​
●​ Role-Based Dashboards: Four types of users will have personalized dashboards –
Admin, Teacher, Student, and Parent. Each dashboard provides role-specific features
and information in a clean, easy-to-navigate UI.​
●​ Core LMS Features: Students and Teachers interact through quizzes and a grading
system, with progress tracking for each student. Other features include a messaging
system, real-time chat for quick communication, and embedded video playback for
course content (all accessible within the dashboards).​
●​ User Accounts (Auth): Secure authentication and authorization for all user roles except
Admin. New users can register, create profiles, and log in. User roles determine access
to certain pages and actions (role-based access control).​
●​ Admin Controls: An advanced Admin dashboard to manage site content and
configuration. The Admin can create blog posts or announcements, add/remove pages,
adjust layouts/themes, and generally configure the entire site’s settings.​
Tech Stack & Tools: We’ll build the LMS using Next.js (a React framework) with TypeScript
for robust typing, styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. We will utilize shadcn/UI
components to speed up building beautiful, accessible dashboard interfaces. Our data will be
stored in PostgreSQL, conveniently hosted via Vercel’s platform (using their integration withproviders like Neon or Supabase). Development will be done in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
with recommended extensions, using Git and GitHub for version control, and deploying the live
app on Vercel for continuous deployment.
Note: The combination of Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/UI will let us create a
polished UI quickly, while TypeScript ensures code quality. PostgreSQL provides a
reliable backend for storing users, courses, and progress data.
Course Timeline and Milestones (Week-by-Week)
To ensure a structured and measurable success path, we’ll break the project into weekly
milestones. Each week focuses on specific goals and deliverables. By the end of each segment,
you’ll have achieved a clear milestone – keeping you motivated and on track.
Week 1: Project Setup & Foundations
Milestone: Set up the development environment, initialize the Next.js project with Tailwind and
TypeScript, and deploy a basic app scaffold to Vercel. By end of this week, you’ll have a live
project URL and a connected database, forming the foundation for all future development.
●​ VSCode Setup: Install VSCode (if not already) and configure it for a smooth developer
experience. Add recommended extensions such as ESLint and Prettier (for code
linting/formatting), Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (for class name auto-completion), and
Visual Studio Code – Vercel extension (optional, helps with deployment). In VSCode
settings, enable format-on-save with Prettier to maintain code style consistency.​
●​ Initialize Next.js Project: Open a VSCode terminal in your desired folder and run the
Next.js setup. Use Create Next App with TypeScript and Tailwind: for example, run npx
create-next-app@latest lms-project --typescript --tailwind (or
manually add Tailwind to the project following the official Tailwind setup guide if needed).
This will create a new Next.js 13+ project configured with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.​
●​ Project Structure Best Practices: Organize your codebase for scalability. Next.js
(especially v13+ with the App Router) encourages a structured file layout. Keep your
code organized by feature/domain:​
○​ Use the app/ directory (or pages/ if using the Pages Router) to separate
pages for each role and major section. For example, you might have routes like
/dashboard/admin, /dashboard/teacher, etc., each with their own layout
and pages.​
○​ Create a components/ folder for reusable UI components (buttons, forms,
cards, etc.), and a lib/ or utils/ folder for helper functions (like dateformatters, API helpers).​
○​ Organize styles and assets: since we use Tailwind, most styles are in JSX using
utility classes, but any global CSS (like Tailwind base styles or fonts) can go in
globals.css. Keep assets like images in the public/ directory.​
○​ We will adhere to a component-driven development approach – building small,
reusable components and composing them into pages. This ensures consistency
and makes the app easier to maintain.​
●​ Initialize Git Repository: Inside the project folder, run git init. Create a .gitignore
(Next.js might have created one already) to exclude node_modules and other secrets.
Make an initial commit of your new Next.js project.​
●​ Create GitHub Repository: On GitHub, create a new repository (let’s call it
“LMS-project”). Follow instructions to add it as a remote to your local project (git
remote add origin <repo-url>) and push your initial commit (git push -u
origin main). Now your code is backed up on GitHub.​
●​ Deploy to Vercel: Sign up or log in to Vercel and create a New Project. Connect your
GitHub account if you haven’t already. Import the newly pushed repository from GitHub
into Vercel – you can do this from Vercel’s dashboard by selecting the repo and clicking
Deployvercel.com. Vercel will automatically detect it’s a Next.js app and apply default
build settings. You can configure environment variables during this setup (or later) for
things like database URLsvercel.com. After deploying, you’ll get a live URL (e.g.,
("Enjoy the
https://lms-project.vercel.app) where your app is hosted.
confetti!" as Vercel says when deployment succeeds.)​
🎉
●​ Set Up PostgreSQL on Vercel: Use Vercel’s integrated database support to set up a
Postgres instance. Vercel offers a Marketplace where you can one-click provision a
Postgres database via partners like Neon or Supabasevercel.com. Go to the Vercel
Integrations marketplace, find a Postgres provider (e.g., Neon), and follow the steps to
link it to your project. This will create a database and automatically inject the connection
string into your Vercel project’s environment variablesvercel.com. (Alternatively, you can
set up a database on your own host and add the credentials to Vercel manually as
environment variables.)​
●​ Verify the Setup: Locally, run npm run dev to ensure the dev server launches. Visit
the deployed Vercel URL to confirm the site is live (it should show the Next.js default
page or a basic index page if you already modified it). This week’s result is a fully set up
development environment: you have code in VSCode with helpful tools, version control
working, and continuous deployment configured. We’re ready to build!
​
🚀Week 2: Building the Landing Page (UI Basics)
Milestone: Develop a visually appealing landing page that will be the front door of your LMS.
By the end of this week, you will have a responsive landing page with a hero section and a
subjects grid, all styled with Tailwind CSS and ready to impress visitors.
●​ Design the Hero Section: The hero is the top section of the landing page – it should
grab attention. Use a large heading to state the platform’s purpose (e.g., “Learn Anytime,
Anywhere” or “Welcome to [Your LMS Name]”) and a subtitle to encourage action (like
“Join classes, take quizzes, track progress”). Include a visually engaging graphic or
illustration; you can use an image (perhaps a relevant education-themed image in the
public folder) or even a background pattern. Style this section with Tailwind utilities: for
example, a full-height section with min-h-screen bg-blue-50 flex
items-center justify-center text-center etc. Add a Call to Action button
(“Get Started” or “Log In”) that will eventually link to the signup/login page.​
●​ Subjects Grid Layout: Below the hero, showcase the subjects or courses available.
Create a grid of subject cards. Each card might display an icon or image for the subject
(e.g., a math icon, science icon, etc.), the subject name, and maybe a brief description.
Using Tailwind, implementing a responsive grid is straightforward: e.g., <div
class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6"> to
have 3 columns on large screens, 2 on small, etc.tw-elements.com. Each card can be a
simple component with a white background, slight shadow (shadow-md), and rounded
corners (rounded-lg). On hover, maybe scale it up slightly or change the shadow for
interactivity.​
●​ Tailwind & shadcn/UI Components: Leverage shadcn/UI for ready-made, accessible
components where appropriate. For example, shadcn/UI provides pre-built components
like Button and Card that we can use for consistent styling. Use the shadcn CLI to add
a component if needed: for instance, running npx shadcn-ui add card will add a
customizable Card component to your projectui.shadcn.com. You can then use it to
structure each subject card uniformly. This saves time and ensures a professional look.​
●​ Visual Notes – Landing Page: The hero section should be eye-catching and
interactive (you could add a subtle animation or a typed text effect for the headline).
The subjects grid should be clean and inviting – consider using Tailwind’s default pastel
background colors for different subjects to differentiate them (e.g., math card with
light-blue background, science with light-green, etc.), and Tailwind’s utility classes for
consistent spacing. Ensure the layout is mobile-friendly (tailwind’s grid classes and flex
utilities help with responsiveness out of the box).​
●​ Routing Setup: Create a Next.js page for the landing (likely the homepage /). Also, set
up basic navigation – for now, perhaps a top nav bar with the site logo and links to“Login” or “Signup”. We will refine this as we implement auth, but having a header that
persists (using Next’s Layout route or a shared <Header /> component) is good to do
now. If using the App Router, create app/(site)/layout.tsx and
app/(site)/page.tsx for the landing layout and content, isolating it from the
dashboards section.​
●​ Deploy & Test: Commit your changes (git commit -am "Add landing page"),
push to GitHub, and let Vercel deploy. Check the live site on desktop and mobile. By the
end of Week 2, you have a fully functional landing page that serves as the marketing and
entry point for your LMS. Great work on the UI fundamentals!​
Week 3: Authentication (User Registration & Login)
Milestone: Implement a secure authentication system. By the end of this week, new users can
register accounts, log in, and be assigned a role (Student, Teacher, or Parent). Protected routes
should redirect unauthenticated users to login, and the app will show/hide navigation options
based on user status.
●​ Choose Auth Method: We will use NextAuth.js (now known as Auth.js) – a popular
authentication library for Next.js – to simplify auth implementation. NextAuth supports
credential-based logins as well as OAuth providers. For our LMS, we’ll implement
credentials authentication (users sign up with email/password), since that fits a custom
LMS scenario. Install NextAuth: npm install next-auth. Also, install an adapter for
PostgreSQL – NextAuth can use an ORM like Prisma or its own adapters. A
straightforward path is to use Prisma ORM with a NextAuth adapter (this requires setting
up Prisma and a database schema for users and accounts). Alternatively, for brevity,
NextAuth can operate without Prisma by storing sessions JWT in cookies and you
writing your own logic to store user info in Postgres. For a beginner-friendly approach,
we suggest using NextAuth’s built-in capabilities first, then integrating deeper with the
database as needed.​
●​ Set Up NextAuth API Route: NextAuth needs a dynamic API route. In Next.js App
Router, create a file at app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts and configure
NextAuth thereaxelerant.comaxelerant.com. Define one or more providers. Initially, use
Email/Password (credentials) provider or a dummy provider for dev. (For production,
you’d implement proper email sign-in or integrate a service like Auth0. But credentials
will let us create our own user records in Postgres for full control.)​
○​ If using NextAuth Credentials provider: in the NextAuth() config, set up
callbacks to handle sign-in. When a user attempts to log in, you will verify their
email/password against the database and return a user object. On successfullogin, NextAuth will create a session for the user.​
○​ Configure NextAuth callbacks to include user roles. For example, in the jwt
callback, attach the user’s role to the token, and in the session callback, copy
that role into the session objectaxelerant.com. This way, the logged-in session
knows the user’s role (e.g., session.user.role = "student").​
○​ You will need to have a users table in Postgres. At minimum, create a table with
columns: id (UUID or int), name, email, hashed_password, role, created_at. (If
using Prisma, define a User model in schema.prisma and run migrations to
create the table).​
●​ User Registration: Build a Sign Up page (e.g., /register route) with a form for
name, email, password, role selection (maybe a dropdown to choose
Student/Parent/Teacher). When the form is submitted, create the user in the database:​
○​ Create a Next.js API route (e.g., app/api/register/route.ts) to handle
registration. In the handler, hash the password (use a library like bcrypt) and
insert the new user into the Postgres DB. For now, mark all new users with role
“student” by default (or use the role chosen in the form if you allow selecting
role).​
○​ Alternatively, you can leverage NextAuth’s built-in email sign-up by enabling an
email provider, but customizing a register endpoint is fine to understand the
process. Ensure to prevent duplicate users (check if email exists).​
○​ After successful registration, you can auto-login the user (NextAuth has a
signIn() function you can call programmatically, or simply redirect them to the
login page with a success message).​
●​ Login Page: Create a Login page (/login) with a form for email and password. Use
NextAuth’s signIn('credentials', {...}) function to log in. NextAuth will handle
setting cookies if the credentials are valid. Provide feedback for wrong credentials.​
●​ Protecting Routes: Now that we have auth in place, ensure the dashboard routes are
protected. Implement Next.js middleware to guard pages:​
○​ Add a middleware.ts file at the project root. In this middleware, you can utilize
NextAuth’s JWT utility to parse the token from cookies (getToken() from
"next-auth/jwt"). If a user is not authenticated and tries to access a
protected path (like /dashboard or anything beyond landing), redirect them to/loginaxelerant.com.​
○​ Also use the middleware to enforce role-based access for certain routes. For
example, only Admin should reach admin pages, only Teachers to teacher pages,
etc. You can define route patterns and check the token’s roleaxelerant.com. For
instance, if the request path starts with /dashboard/admin and token.role
!== 'admin', redirect to a “/no-access” page or back to the dashboard with an
error. This centralizes your authorization logic.​
○​ NextAuth (Auth.js) makes role-based route protection easier by storing the role in
the session token, as we did. The middleware runs before rendering, ensuring
unauthorized users are redirected early.​
●​ Update Navigation & State: Once login/logout works, update the app’s UI to reflect
authentication state:​
○​ Show “Login” and “Register” buttons on the nav when no user is logged in; if a
user is logged in, show their name or a profile link, and a “Logout” button.​
○​ Possibly create a context or use NextAuth’s useSession() hook in client
components to get session data and conditionally display links. E.g., only show
the “Dashboard” link if session?.user exists.​
●​ Testing Auth Flows: Manually test registering a new user, logging in, and trying to
access protected pages. Also test that a logged-out user cannot directly navigate to
/dashboard/student (they should be redirected to login).​
●​ Deploy to Vercel: Don’t forget to add any necessary environment variables on Vercel
(e.g., NextAuth secret, database URL). Commit and push your changes; verify on the
live site that login and registration flows work as expected.​
●​ Security Note: For this educational project, we implemented a basic credentials auth. In
a real-world scenario, ensure to use HTTPS in production, secure cookies, and possibly
integrate advanced auth providers or two-factor auth for more security. NextAuth’s
documentation and Next.js guide on authentication have more tips on securing API
routes and using a proper Data Access Layer for all auth checksnextjs.org. For now, our
focus is on getting a working system. Congratulations – by the end of Week 3, you have
a multi-user system where people can sign up and log in!
​
🔐
Week 4: Dashboard Layouts & Navigation (UI for Authenticated Users)Milestone: Create the structural layout for each type of user dashboard using shadcn/UI
components and Tailwind. By the end of this week, after login, users will see a personalized
dashboard page (even if features are minimal initially) with navigation menus to access different
sections (quizzes, messages, profile, etc.). We’ll set up the scaffold for features to be built in
upcoming weeks.
●​ Plan Dashboard Sections: For each role (Student, Teacher, Parent, Admin), list what
sections or pages their dashboard will contain. For example:​
○​ Student Dashboard: overview of courses enrolled, recent quiz scores, a link to
take new quizzes or view learning materials, progress chart, messages.​
○​ Teacher Dashboard: class or course management (which courses they teach),
pending assignments or quizzes to grade, student progress overview, messaging
center.​
○​ Parent Dashboard: overview of their child(ren)’s performance, recent grades,
messages from teachers.​
○​ Admin Dashboard: site overview (number of users, latest content), and admin
controls like content management, user management, site settings.​
●​ Shared Dashboard Layout: Use Next.js layout route or a React component to define a
common dashboard shell that can be used by all roles with slight variations:​
○​ Likely, all dashboards will have a sidebar navigation (for switching between
sections) and a top bar (for profile menu, notifications, etc.).​
○​ Use shadcn/UI Sidebar component to create a responsive sidebar
menuui.shadcn.comui.shadcn.com. The sidebar can list links like
“Home/Overview”, “Quizzes”, “Messages”, etc., depending on role. The shadcn
Sidebar can be toggled on mobile (burger menu). Each link can highlight when
active. Because we have different roles, you might conditionally render certain
menu items (e.g., Admin sees an “Admin Panel” link that others don’t).​
○​ The top bar can show the app logo/title, and on the right, the logged-in user’s
name with a dropdown (shadcn has an Avatar and Dropdown Menu component
which you can use for a profile menu).​
●​ Styling with Tailwind & shadcn: Tailwind utility classes combined with shadcn
components give a quick way to achieve a professional look. For instance, apply a
consistent color scheme (maybe a light gray sidebar with dark text, and a brighter
highlight for active menu items using Tailwind classes). Shadcn’s components come with
beautiful default styles that ensure a consistent designsystemui.shadcn.comui.shadcn.com, so leverage that. The components are also fully
accessible and customizable – you can adjust them to fit your desired theme.​
●​ Dashboard Home Pages: For each role, create a basic Dashboard Home page (e.g.,
pages/dashboard/student/index.tsx or app/dashboard/student/page.tsx
depending on your router setup). This page will be shown when the user logs in (after
redirect). For now, populate it with a welcome message (“Hello, [Name]”) and some
placeholder stats or information. For example, Student’s home could say “You are
enrolled in X courses. Your overall grade average is Y%. Keep it up!” – these can be
dummy values initially or fetched from the database if you have data. The goal is to have
distinct pages so we can later fill them with real data.​
●​ Role-Based Routing: Ensure that each role’s pages are only accessible to that role. We
partially did this with middleware in Week 3, but now that pages exist, test it:​
○​ If a Student tries to access an Admin URL, they should be redirected away (or
see a “No Access” message). We can implement a simple NoAccess page for
such cases.​
○​ NextAuth’s session object is available client-side via useSession(). You can
also do server-side checks (for example, in a server component or
getServerSideProps if using Pages Router) to redirect unauthorized users.
For critical data, always double-check on the server that the user has
permissionnextjs.org.​
●​ Breadcrumbs & Navigation Aids: Consider adding a breadcrumb or page title on each
dashboard page to improve orientation. E.g., if the Teacher is on the “Grade Quiz” page,
show “Dashboard > Quizzes > Quiz #3 Results” at top. This can be a small UI element
but helps the user know where they are. Tailwind styling (small text, italics) is enough for
now.​
●​ Visual Notes – Dashboard Design: The dashboard’s look should be clean and
functional. Think of it as an internal tool for users. Use cards or panels to group
information. For example, on the Student overview, you might have a progress card
(showing a progress bar of course completion), a recent activity card, etc. On the
Admin dashboard, maybe cards showing number of users, latest posts, etc. Use the
shadcn Card component or Tailwind div with classes like bg-white shadow
rounded p-4 for these panels.​
●​ Embed Example:​Example of a modern dashboard layout built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS (illustrative of the
style we aim to create for our dashboards).
●​ Deploy & Verify: Commit and push the dashboard structure. On Vercel, test logging in
as each role (you may need to assign roles manually in the database for testing – e.g.,
update a user to role “teacher” in the DB). Verify that the correct dashboard appears and
navigation links work. This week’s achievement is the skeleton of our application’s
protected area – all the dashboards are in place, ready to be filled with interactive
features. Excellent progress!​
Week 5: Implementing Core LMS Features (Quizzes, Grading, Progress
Tracking)
Milestone: Introduce the educational features of the LMS. This week, you will enable quiz
taking for students, grading by teachers, and progress tracking visible to students (and parents).
By week’s end, you’ll have a basic quiz system: students can take quizzes and get scores,
teachers can input grades, and the system records progress.
●​ Database Schema for Courses & Quizzes: Extend your PostgreSQL database to
handle course content:​
○​ Create tables such as Course, Lesson, Quiz, Question, Answer, Enrollment,
Grade, etc. For simplicity, you could start with a Quiz table (quiz_id, course_id,
title, etc.), a Question table (question text, options, correct answer), and a
Result/Grade table (user_id, quiz_id, score, etc.).​
○​ If using Prisma, define these models in schema.prisma and generate
migrations. If not, you can run SQL commands directly (via a tool like pgAdmin or
a simple Next.js API route that runs raw SQL using pg library).​
●​ Quiz Taking (Student side): Create a Quiz Page under the student dashboard (e.g.,
/dashboard/student/quizzes/[quizId]). This page will fetch quiz questions
from the database and render a form for the student to answer. You can load data using
Next.js data fetching (if using App Router, you might fetch inside the component or have
a server action to fetch questions).​
○​ Use a form library or simple state to capture answers. On submit, evaluate the
score (compare with correct answers) and send the result to the backend to
save.​
○​ Save the quiz attempt: create an API route like
app/api/quizzes/[quizId]/submit to accept the answers, calculate the
grade (score percentage or points), and insert a record into the Grade/Resulttable for that student.nextjs.orgnextjs.org (The example in Next.js docs shows
checking session and role in an API route, which you should do here: ensure the
user is a student and enrolled in the course before accepting their submission).​
○​ After submission, show the student their score and maybe correct answers for
learning purposes.​
●​ Quiz Management (Teacher side): Teachers need a UI to create quizzes and view
results:​
○​ Add a Create Quiz page for teachers (/dashboard/teacher/quizzes/new).
This can be a form where a teacher enters quiz title, selects a course (if multiple
courses exist), and adds questions and choices. For adding multiple questions,
consider either a dynamic form (where teacher can click “Add Question” to
append fields) or create a basic version that handles a single question at a time.
For brevity, you could seed the database with a quiz instead of building a full UI
for creating quizzes (depending on time).​
○​ A Gradebook page for teachers (/dashboard/teacher/grades): list quizzes
and the average scores or allow the teacher to pick a quiz and see all student
submissions. Teachers can click on a specific student’s submission to view
details (perhaps eventually to add comments or adjust scores).​
○​ Note: If a quiz is automatically graded (multiple-choice), the score can be
calculated by the system. If there are open-ended parts, you’d need teacher
input. To keep it simple, focus on auto-graded quizzes for now.​
●​ Progress Tracking: For students (and parents), show progress in their dashboard:​
○​ Define what “progress” means: it could be the percentage of course modules
completed or average quiz score. For example, if a course has 5 quizzes and the
student completed 3, progress = 60%. Or if progress is based on lesson
completion, track that. An easier metric is quiz completion or grades average.​
○​ On the Student Dashboard Home, add a Progress component. This could be
a simple progress bar (Tailwind has utility classes for progress bars, or use
shadcn’s Progress componentui.shadcn.com if available). Show something like
“Course Completion: 60%” or “Average Grade: B (85%)”.​
○​ Parents should see their child’s progress similarly. If Parent accounts are linked
to Student accounts (you need a way to associate a parent with one or more
students, e.g., a parent_user_id field in the student’s record or a separate
mapping table), fetch the relevant student’s data for display. For our project, youmight simplify by assuming one parent to one student mapping for now.​
●​ Messaging System (Setup): This week, also set the stage for messaging. Create a
Messages page for each role. For Students and Teachers, this might be like an inbox of
messages. It could be as simple as a list of conversations or threads. Implementing real
messaging from scratch is complex, so we’ll do a basic version:​
○​ Make a database table Message (id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp,
read_flag).​
○​ On the Messages page, list messages where the logged-in user is either sender
or receiver. Provide a form to send a new message. For now, you can allow free
text sending by specifying the recipient (maybe a dropdown of all users or filtered
by some relationship).​
○​ This is essentially like email. Real-time chat will be handled separately next
week.​
○​ Ensure only authorized users can send/receive (you might want to restrict certain
combos, e.g., a student can only message teachers or admin, etc., depending on
your use case).​
●​ UI for Features: Use component-driven design to create pieces of the UI:​
○​ A QuizCard component to show a quiz on the dashboard (e.g., “Quiz 1: Algebra
Basics – Score: 80%”). The student dashboard can list recent quizzes or
upcoming quizzes in a card format.​
○​ A MessageItem component for an individual message in a list, showing sender,
subject (if any), snippet of content, and whether it’s read (maybe bold if unread).​
○​ Use shadcn/UI elements for consistency: for instance, use shadcn’s Alert or
Badge components to highlight new messages or grades. Use Modal/Dialog
component if you want to show quiz results or message details in a popup.​
●​ Testing: Simulate a scenario: create a quiz in the database (if UI not fully done for
creation), then log in as a student to take it, see the result, then log in as teacher to view
that result. Check the progress bar updates if you define it that way. Send a message
from a teacher to a student, then log as student to see it.​
●​ Deploy: Push all new features to GitHub and deploy. This is a big week’s work – you’ve
introduced the brain of the LMS! Students can actively take quizzes and track progress.
Teachers can oversee student performance.​(By now, our LMS has real educational utility: accounts, content, assessments, and progress
metrics. Next, we’ll make the experience even more dynamic.)
Week 6: Real-Time Features – Live Chat and Notifications
Milestone: Add real-time capabilities to enhance user interaction. By the end of this week, the
LMS will support a basic live chat (for example, student-to-teacher chat or a group chat) and
instant notifications (e.g., a parent gets notified when a student completes a quiz).
●​ Real-Time Chat Architecture: Next.js doesn’t maintain persistent WebSocket
connections natively (since serverless functions are stateless), so we’ll integrate a
service for real-time communication:​
○​ One option is Pusher (a hosted service for websockets) – it has a free tier and
straightforward integration with Next.js. Another is using Socket.io by running a
separate Node server or using Next.js Middleware with Edge runtime for limited
realtime.​
○​ For our project’s scope, we’ll outline using Pusher. Install the pusher-js client
in your app. On the server side, you can use Pusher’s REST API or their official
Node package to trigger events.​
○​ Determine chat channels: maybe each classroom or course has a channel, or
each student-teacher pair has a private channel. For simplicity, implement a
support chat style feature where a student can send a message to a teacher in
real-time (like asking a question during a lesson). This could be one channel per
course or per user pair.​
●​ Chat UI: Create a Chat component that can be used in relevant pages (perhaps a “Live
Chat” page under student and teacher dashboards). The Chat component will:​
○​ Display messages (you can reuse the MessageItem component or style
differently for chat bubbles).​
○​ Have an input box to send a new message. When the user sends, you’ll both
save it to the DB (so history is preserved) and send a real-time event via Pusher
so the other user’s client gets it instantly.​
○​ Subscribe to Pusher channels in a useEffect on the client side. When a new
message event arrives, update the chat message list state.​
○​ For now, you might not implement typing indicators or presence (that’s more
advanced), but ensure messages appear in real-time without a page refresh.​●​ Notifications: Implement a simple notification system for events like quiz graded or new
message:​
○​ One approach: use the database to store notifications (a Notification table: id,
user_id, type, message, created_at, read_flag). Insert a notification when certain
events happen (e.g., after a student submits a quiz, create a notification for the
teacher or parent; when teacher grades something or sends a message, create
notification for student).​
○​ On the client, you can poll for new notifications or better, also use real-time
events. For example, when a quiz is submitted, trigger a Pusher event to the
parent’s channel: “quiz_completed”.​
○​ The simplest path in our context: on each dashboard page load, query for any
new notifications for the user and display them (like “You have a new message
from Teacher A” or “Your quiz has been graded”). This could be a bell icon in the
top bar – clicking it drops down a list of notifications. Mark them as read when
viewed.​
●​ Visual Integration: Use small UI touches to indicate real-time aspects:​
○​ Perhaps a badge on the chat menu item to show number of unread chats.​
○​ A notification bell icon (could use a heroicon or any icon, styled with Tailwind to
appear in the header).​
○​ For chat messages UI, use distinct styling for messages sent vs received
(different background color, align right vs left).​
●​ Backend for Real-Time: If using Pusher, you’ll need to set up a Pusher app (get API
keys) and add those keys to your environment variables (both client key for frontend and
secret for server-side). Create API routes that Pusher will call for authentication if you
use private channels. Due to time, an alternative is to simulate “real-time” by using
simple long-polling or frequent checks – but since this is a teaching project, explaining
the modern approach is valuable.​
○​ If not using an external service, Next.js 13 introduced experimental WebSocket
support via the Edge runtime and some libraries, but it’s advanced. Pusher or a
similar service like Supabase Realtime (which uses WebSockets under the hood)
is more straightforward.​
●​ Test the Chat: Open two accounts in two browsers (or one incognito) – e.g., log in as
student in one and teacher in another. Navigate to the chat page and send a message
as student; it should appear for the teacher in real time (and vice versa). If not using areal service, at least ensure the messages can be sent and if you refresh the other side it
shows up.​
●​ Reflect on Real-Time: Adding real-time functionality is a huge step towards making the
LMS feel interactive and engaging. Even a basic chat can greatly enhance the learning
experience (e.g., instant doubt clearing between student and teacher).​
●​ Deployment Considerations: If using Pusher or any external service, ensure the keys
(like Pusher’s app key, secret) are set in Vercel environment. Push the changes and test
on the deployed site as well. Real-time features might require SSL (which Vercel
provides by default on its domains) and proper config of keys – double check those.​
By the end of Week 6, our LMS supports dynamic, real-time communication.

Week 7: Multimedia Integration – Embedded Videos & Rich Content
Milestone: Enrich the LMS with multimedia content. This week, you’ll add the ability to embed
video lessons into the platform and ensure the text content (like blog posts or course pages)
supports rich text or HTML. By the end, teachers can share video lessons, and students can
watch within the app, and the admin can add rich blog content.
●​ Video Playback in Courses: Often, LMS platforms host video lectures. We’ll enable
embedding videos:​
○​ Easiest approach: use external video hosting (like YouTube or Vimeo) and
embed via iframe, or use HTML5 video for small files. Since hosting videos
ourselves is heavy, you can allow a field in the course or lesson for a YouTube
URL.​
○​ Create a VideoLesson component that takes a video URL. If it’s YouTube, you
can embed using the iframe embed code. If it’s a direct file URL, use <video
controls src="...">. Next.js can optimize local video if needed, but
streaming from YouTube is simplest.​
○​ Add a Lessons page for students (under their course view) that lists video
lessons and resources. For each lesson, include the VideoLesson component
and maybe some description or transcript below.​
○​ Ensure that the video area is responsive (iframes can be made responsive by
wrapping in a div with aspect-ratio styles or use Tailwind’s aspect-video utility
if available).​●​ Rich Text Content (Blog/Announcements): The Admin should be able to create blog
posts or announcements with rich text (formatted text, images, etc.). We won’t build a full
rich text editor here, but we can integrate something like:​
○​ Use a Markdown library or a WYSIWYG editor component. For example, you
could integrate React Quill or TipTap for a rich text editor on the admin side,
allowing them to format content.​
○​ If that’s too much, simply allow admin to write in Markdown and store the
markdown, then render it on the blog page using a markdown-to-HTML renderer.​
○​ Set up a Blog page (which could be public or behind admin, depending if it’s for
everyone to read or just an admin preview). Possibly the blog is meant for public
news, so a public route /blog listing posts, and admin can add posts there.​
○​ In the admin dashboard, create a New Post page. Provide a form with at least a
title and content field. The content can be a <textarea> that the admin can
input Markdown. Save this to a Post table in the database.​
○​ On the public blog page, fetch posts and render the content. If using Markdown,
use a library like marked or remark to convert to HTML (be cautious with raw
HTML for XSS).​
●​ Admin Page Management: The requirement mentioned “page addition/removal, layout
modifications”. Implement a basic version of this:​
○​ Perhaps allow the Admin to toggle some site settings like theme (light/dark or
primary color) – which could simply be a toggle that adds a CSS class for dark
mode (Tailwind supports dark mode easily) or changes a Tailwind color variable.
Shadcn/UI theming can also be configured (they have a theming guide).​
○​ Page addition/removal could refer to static pages (like an “About Us” page). For
simplicity, you could let Admin create new pages in the blog system (like treating
them as pages).​
○​ Another interpretation: allow admin to show/hide certain sections on the landing
page or add a new menu link. Doing this dynamically is complex, but you might
simulate it by giving admin a JSON config for the homepage sections. This may
be beyond a beginner scope – so it’s okay to note that a fully dynamic layout
system is advanced.​
○​ Focus on demonstrating one aspect: e.g., Admin can update the landing page
welcome text or hero image. You can make a field in the database for “site
configuration” that includes that text, and have the landing page read from it.Admin UI would allow editing that text. This shows the concept of content
management.​
●​ Visual Consistency: Ensure that the new components (video player, text editor, etc.)
match the site’s style.​
○​ Use Tailwind to style the video container (center it, give it proper spacing).​
○​ The blog post content can be styled with a set of prose classes (Tailwind has
prose class via @tailwindcss/typography plugin for styling markdown content
automatically – worth exploring if time permits).​
○​ Buttons and forms for Admin actions should reuse existing styles (maybe use the
shadcn Button component for Save/Publish actions, etc., to maintain
consistency).​
●​ Testing: Have the Admin user add a blog post via the UI; check that it appears on the
blog page. Add a video URL for a lesson in the database or via a simple form and
ensure it plays on the student side. Check on different devices that the video is
responsive.​
●​ Deployment: Push changes and test on the live URL. Video embedding should work on
Vercel as long as the links are correct (if YouTube embed doesn’t show, ensure no CSP
issues – Vercel generally allows it, but if needed you might adjust Next.js config for
allowed domains).​
By the end of Week 7, the LMS is content-rich: it supports multimedia learning (videos) and
content management (blogs/announcements) through the admin. This not only makes the
platform more engaging but also gives the admin fine control over the site’s content and
appearance.
Week 8: Polishing, Testing, and Final Touches
Milestone: In the final week, we focus on refinement – fixing any bugs, enhancing UI
consistency, writing documentation (so future developers or students understand the project),
and ensuring all requirements are met. By the end, you will have a fully functional LMS and a
solid understanding of the technologies used!
●​ UI/UX Polish: Review every page for consistency and usability:​
○​ Ensure responsive design across the app. Use Chrome’s device toolbar or real
devices to test the landing page, dashboards, etc. Make adjustments with
Tailwind breakpoints (e.g., sm:, md: classes) so that layouts don’t break onsmaller screens. Common fixes might include collapsing sidebar on mobile,
stacking columns into single column, making text sizes appropriate on small
screens, etc.​
○​ Add any missing accessibility attributes (alt text for images, aria-label for
icons, proper focus management for modal dialogs, etc.). Shadcn/UI components
are accessible by default, but double-check custom parts.​
○​ Check color contrast for readability. Tailwind’s default palette is generally
accessible, but if you chose custom colors for themes, use tools to ensure
sufficient contrast.​
●​ Performance Check: Next.js and Vercel handle a lot of optimization automatically
(bundling, minification, etc.). Still, ensure you’re not doing anything slow on the client:​
○​ Lazy-load what can be deferred (Next’s dynamic import can code-split large
modules like a rich text editor or heavy charts).​
○​ If you added any large images, ensure they are optimized (Next’s Image
component or using appropriate sizes).​
○​ The database queries should be efficient – if you used Prisma or an ORM, check
for N+1 query issues or use indexes for frequently queried fields (like user_id in
grades, etc.).​
●​ Finalize Role-Based Restrictions: Make a final audit of security:​
○​ Verify that pages and API routes properly restrict access. For example, a student
hitting an API endpoint to create a quiz should be rejected on the server side
even if they tried (this means checking session.user.role on those API
routes, similar to our earlier check where only admin should succeed for admin
actionsnextjs.org).​
○​ Use middleware and server checks together: middleware for quick redirect,
server for true protectionnextjs.orgnextjs.org.​
○​ Remove any test accounts or default credentials you used during development
before final deployment.​
●​ Documentation & README: Write a clear README.md for your project repository that
outlines:​○​ Setup instructions (how to run locally, how to set env variables like NextAuth
secret, etc.).​
○​ Brief overview of the architecture (you can reuse some of the content from this
guide: the stack, the purpose of each major folder).​
○​ Instructions for seeding the database (if you have a seed script, mention how to
use it; e.g., create an admin user manually with a SQL insert so the admin can
log in since we excluded admin from self-signup).​
○​ Any shortcuts or assumptions in the project (for example, “Admin account is
created manually in the database; there is no admin registration flow for security
reasons”).​
○​ Future improvements or challenges (this helps students think about what they
could do next or what they learned).​
●​ Visual Walkthrough: It might be helpful to add screenshots or a short video demo in
your README or as part of final documentation for the user. Show the landing page, a
student dashboard, a quiz attempt, an admin editing a blog, etc., to celebrate the
finished product.​
●​ Final Test as a User: Imagine yourself in each role:​
○​ As a new visitor: can I see the landing, understand what to do, register easily?​
○​ As a student: after logging in, can I find my courses, take a quiz, view my
progress, chat if needed?​
○​ As a teacher: can I view student progress, send messages, perhaps create
content?​
○​ As a parent: is it clear how to see my child’s info?​
○​ As an admin: can I manage the site content?​
○​ Any confusing element, take the time to add a tooltip or help text. For instance, if
a Parent logs in but you only allow them to view one student, maybe the UI
should explicitly say the child’s name they’re viewing.​
●​ Celebrate and Deploy Final Version: Push the last commits. Maybe tag it as v1.0 in
git. Ensure Vercel deployment is successful. Do a final smoke test on the production
URL. And you’re done – you have built a comprehensive Full-Stack LearningManagement System!​
Conclusion & What You’ve Learned
Over 8 weeks, you transformed from a beginner to an intermediate full-stack developer. You’ve
learned to set up a modern development environment, implement authentication and role-based
authorization, design complex front-end layouts with Tailwind CSS and component libraries,
work with a relational database via Next.js, and even add real-time features and multimedia
content. You also practiced best practices in file structure and code organization, creating a
scalable codebase that’s easier to maintain and expand.
👍
This project’s success (and your 90%+ progress rate
) comes from the step-by-step
approach: each week building upon the last, iteratively adding pieces while reinforcing previous
concepts. Remember that there’s always room to improve – you might enhance this LMS with
more features (like assignments, forums, or integrations with external APIs) or refactor parts of
the code for optimization. But as it stands, you have a functional, deployed application to be
proud of.
Next Steps: If you’d like to continue learning, consider:
●​ Writing automated tests for your application (using Jest or Cypress) to ensure everything
works and prevent regressions.​
●​ Expanding the LMS with additional features such as scheduling (calendar for
assignments), notifications via email, or a mobile-friendly PWA experience.​
●​ Diving deeper into each technology: e.g., mastering NextAuth’s nuances, exploring
advanced Tailwind configurations, or optimizing database interactions with indexing and
caching.
