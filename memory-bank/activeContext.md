- ✅ **TypeScript Interfaces**: Complete type definitions for all data models

### Authentication System
- ✅ **Login/Register Pages**: Functional authentication forms with demo accounts
- ✅ **AuthService**: Custom authentication service with role-based access
- ✅ **Mock Users**: Demo accounts for all roles (admin, teacher, student, parent)
- ✅ **Role-based Redirects**: Users redirect to appropriate dashboards after login

### Landing Page

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Week 5 Implementation)
1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Push current codebase to GitHub

2. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Deploy application to Vercel hosting
   - Configure environment variables

3. **Database Setup**
   - Create PostgreSQL database through Vercel integration
   - Set up database connection string
   - Prepare for Prisma ORM integration

### Week 5 Implementation Plan
1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Install and configure Prisma ORM
   - Create database schema for courses, quizzes, questions, grades
   - Run initial migrations

2. **Quiz System Development**
   - Create quiz creation interface for teachers
   - Implement quiz-taking interface for students
   - Build automatic grading system for multiple-choice questions
   - Add quiz results storage and display

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Implement course completion tracking
   - Create progress visualization components
   - Add grade calculation and display

4. **Basic Messaging System**
   - Create message database schema
   - Implement send/receive message functionality
   - Build inbox interface for all user roles

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Database Choice
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Vercel integration
**Rationale**: 
- Seamless integration with Vercel hosting
- Robust relational database for complex LMS data relationships
- Good performance for educational platform requirements

### ORM Selection
**Decision**: Prisma ORM
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe database access with TypeScript
- Excellent Next.js integration
- Automatic migration management
- Great developer experience

### Authentication Strategy
**Current**: Custom AuthService with mock data
**Future**: Migrate to NextAuth.js for production
**Consideration**: Keep current system for Week 5, migrate later for security

### State Management
**Current**: Local React state and custom AuthService
**Future Consideration**: May need global state management (Zustand/Redux) as features grow
**Decision**: Continue with current approach for Week 5

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Component Development
- **shadcn/UI First**: Always check if shadcn/UI has a suitable component before building custom
- **Composition Pattern**: Build components that compose well together
- **TypeScript Props**: All components must have properly typed props
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based Structure**: Group related components and logic together
- **Clear Separation**: Keep UI components separate from business logic
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions
- **Import Organization**: Maintain consistent import order

### Data Handling
- **Type-first Approach**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementation
- **Validation**: Use Zod schemas for all form validation
- **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Always show loading indicators for async operations

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Component Architecture**: The shadcn/UI + Tailwind combination provides rapid development
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors early and improves developer experience
3. **File Organization**: Feature-based structure makes code easy to find and maintain
4. **Mock Data Strategy**: Allows frontend development without backend dependencies

### Challenges Identified
1. **Authentication Complexity**: Role-based access control requires careful implementation
2. **Data Relationships**: LMS data has complex relationships that need careful schema design
3. **Real-time Requirements**: Future chat and notification features will need WebSocket integration
4. **Performance Considerations**: Large datasets will require optimization strategies

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Next.js App Router**: Provides modern React patterns and better performance
2. **Component Composition**: Enables reusable and maintainable UI components
3. **Service Layer Pattern**: Centralizes business logic and makes testing easier
4. **Role-based Access Control**: Ensures proper security and user experience

## Development Workflow

### Current Process
1. **Component Development**: Build UI components with shadcn/UI and Tailwind
2. **Type Definition**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
3. **Mock Data Integration**: Use mock data to develop and test functionality
4. **Responsive Testing**: Ensure mobile compatibility throughout development

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Test all user flows across different roles
- **Responsive Testing**: Verify mobile and desktop layouts
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across modern browsers
- **Role-based Testing**: Verify access control for all user types

### Quality Assurance
- **TypeScript Compilation**: No TypeScript errors allowed
- **ESLint Compliance**: Follow established linting rules
- **Component Consistency**: Maintain consistent styling and behavior
- **User Experience**: Ensure intuitive navigation and clear feedback

## Environment Status

### Development Environment
- ✅ **Next.js Setup**: Fully configured with App Router
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with comprehensive types
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Configured with shadcn/UI integration
- ✅ **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement in place
- ⏳ **Database**: Pending Vercel PostgreSQL setup
- ⏳ **Deployment**: Pending Vercel hosting configuration

### Required Environment Variables (Pending)
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=...
```

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
1. **Database Migration Complexity**: Moving from mock data to real database requires careful planning
2. **Authentication Security**: Current mock auth needs to be replaced with secure solution
3. **Performance**: No optimization for large datasets yet
4. **Real-time Features**: Chat and notifications will require significant architecture changes

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Migration**: Replace mock data gradually, feature by feature
2. **Security Review**: Plan NextAuth.js migration after core features are stable
3. **Performance Planning**: Design database schema with indexing and optimization in mind
4. **Architecture Preparation**: Design components to support future real-time features
