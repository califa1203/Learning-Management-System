## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock Data Dependency**: All data is currently mock data stored in files
2. **Authentication Security**: Using simple localStorage-based auth (not production-ready)
3. **No Persistence**: User actions don't persist between sessions
4. **No Real-time Features**: No live updates or notifications
5. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic error handling in place

### Technical Debt
1. **Database Migration**: Need to replace all mock data imports
2. **Authentication Upgrade**: Should migrate to NextAuth.js for production
3. **State Management**: May need global state management as features grow
4. **Performance**: No optimization for large datasets
5. **Testing**: No automated tests implemented

### UI/UX Improvements Needed
1. **Loading States**: More comprehensive loading indicators
2. **Error Messages**: Better user feedback for errors
3. **Empty States**: Proper empty state handling
4. **Accessibility**: Full accessibility audit needed
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Further mobile experience refinement

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Next.js App Router**: Chosen for modern React patterns and performance
2. **TypeScript**: Implemented for type safety and better developer experience
3. **Tailwind + shadcn/UI**: Selected for rapid development and consistency
4. **Component Composition**: Adopted for reusability and maintainability

### Data Strategy Evolution
1. **Started with**: Hardcoded data in components
2. **Moved to**: Centralized mock data files
3. **Next step**: Database integration with Prisma
4. **Future**: Optimized queries and caching

### Authentication Strategy Evolution
1. **Started with**: No authentication
2. **Current**: Custom AuthService with localStorage
3. **Next step**: Keep current for Week 5 development
4. **Future**: Migrate to NextAuth.js for production security

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks and Mitigations
1. **Database Migration Complexity**
   - Risk: Breaking existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Incremental migration, feature by feature

2. **Performance with Real Data**
   - Risk: Slow queries with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, query optimization

3. **Authentication Security**
   - Risk: Current auth not production-ready
   - Mitigation: Plan NextAuth.js migration after core features

4. **Real-time Feature Complexity**
   - Risk: WebSocket integration challenges
   - Mitigation: Start with simple polling, upgrade to WebSockets

## Next Milestone Preparation

### Ready for Week 5
- ‚úÖ **Codebase**: Clean, well-organized, and documented
- ‚úÖ **Types**: All data models defined
- ‚úÖ **UI Components**: Complete component library
- ‚úÖ **Architecture**: Scalable patterns established
- ‚è≥ **Database**: Pending Vercel setup
- ‚è≥ **Deployment**: Pending Vercel configuration

### Week 5 Implementation Strategy
1. **Database First**: Set up Prisma and schema before feature development
2. **Incremental Migration**: Replace mock data one feature at a time
3. **Test Continuously**: Verify each feature works with real data
4. **Maintain Quality**: Keep TypeScript strict, ESLint passing
5. **Document Changes**: Update memory bank as features are completed

The project is in excellent shape to begin Week 5 implementation once the GitHub and Vercel setup is complete.
